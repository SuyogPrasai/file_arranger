# File Arranger

Welcome to the File Arranger Python program! This Python script helps you organize files in a directory by moving them to specific folders based on their file extensions. It simplifies file management and keeps your directory clean and organized.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

The File Arranger script performs the following tasks:

1. **Initialization**: Reads a configuration file (`Data/files.json`) that defines the mapping of file extensions to folder names.

2. **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter the target directory where files need to be organized.

3. **File Scanning**: Scans the target directory and identifies files (excluding subdirectories).

4. **File Movement**: Moves each file to the appropriate folder based on its file extension, as defined in the configuration file.

5. **Cleanup**: Removes empty directories from the target directory after file organization.

## Features ‚ú®

- **File Organization**: Automatically organizes files into folders based on their extensions.
- **Customizable**: You can customize the mapping of file extensions to folder names in the configuration file.
- **Error Handling**: The script handles common errors, such as existing directories and destination folder not found.

## Usage üöÄ

To use the File Arranger Python script, follow these steps:

1. Run the script in a Python environment, preferably in the same directory where your files are located.

2. Enter the target directory where files need to be organized when prompted:

   ```python
   Enter your directory: /path/to/target_directory
   ```

3. The script will organize the files based on their extensions into the specified folders.

4. After organization, the script will remove empty directories from the target directory.

## Configuration üìù
You can customize the file organization by modifying the Data/files.json configuration file. This file defines the mapping of file extensions to folder names. Update this file to match your specific needs.
